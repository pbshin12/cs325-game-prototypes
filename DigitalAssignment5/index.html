<h2>Peter's Digital Assignment 5: Chaotic Community Service</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<p>This game is a collection game with a twist, you can only collect items with a box and touching items without the box will hurt you.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<p>I had implemented an improved version of tracking time from my second prototype by utilizing the time event function from Phaser. Also, this game is more involved because there are a total of 7 keys to press (4 to move, and 3 to rotate the box)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<p>Keeping track of what I am doing was definitely the hardest part of making it. There's a lot going on in this game and pulling everything together was quite a challenge. Other than that, I learned how to implement the time event function from the Phaser 3 API and was able to use two for this project.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<p>
    This game derives from Phaser's "build your first game" tutorial, but 90% of this prototype was made from scratch. I remember a scene from Undertale where the player has to rotate a shield to block spears and I took inspiration from that idea.

</ul>
<p>The rest were either made from scratch, pulled from Phaser documentation, or were pulled from my previous works</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<p>Collect all the trash and save the dogs while avoiding getting hit</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>Cleaning, round and round</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<p>The input for this game is mostly direct and uses arrow keys to move and WAD keys to rotate the box/bin (however you call it).
    There is some randomness when it comes to spawn locations, but it is mostly deterministic on the player's side. The play style is collector and, depending on how you look at it, it's kind of a platformer or maybe even fighting (but that's stretching it). For now I'll leave it as platformer.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<p>I wanted to see how well a player can follow instructions and also how to make intricate parts of the puzzle communicate with each other</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<p>I want players to be challenged by an unique form of the collecting mechanic.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay (INSTRUCTIONS ARE LOCATED HERE):</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<p>
    The main controls are the arrow keys and WAD. Both the left and right arrow keys will move the character left and right and the up key will make the player jump. W will put the box to the left, D will but the box to the right, and W will place the box above the character's head.
    When you capture a dog, you can take the dog to the shelter (for now the shelter is the Black box on the right side of the screen). When you've successfully catch trash with the box, you'll earn 10 points. If you've captured a dog, it'll increment the captured counter, but when you return the dog to the shelter, you'll receive 50 x the amount of dogs that you return.
    Players should be mindful that the dogs can spawn from either direction. A hit from either a trash bag or a dog will decrease the number of captured dogs by a half.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<p>I will expect some players to realize that, due to the odd nature of hitboxes in this game (I couldn't figure out the fix), it is much safer to catch the trash by placing the box on its side since it is longer when its vertically oriented.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<p>
    It appears to be just your regular day at work cleaning the park and ensuring the safety of its visitors when all of a sudden, a rocket that was meant to carry garbage to space exploded, dropping all of the trash and debris toward the park. Amidst the chaos, dogs were also escaping from their owners and its your job to take them to a nearby shelter so that they are safe.
    <p>The scenario for this game coincides with the gameplay because the whole point of the game is to collect falling debris and capturing the escapees and sending them to somewhere safe</p>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<p>This game is intended for audiences aged 10 and up</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<p>This game should take no more than 5 minutes to play</p>
</li>
