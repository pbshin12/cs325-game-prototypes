<h2>Peter's Digital Assignment 4: Don't Explode Granny (Please read instructions at the bottom)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<p>This game is a puzzle game that tests how well a player can follow instructions. Any wrong inputs will cause grandma to explode, which is essentially a more intense version of Simon Says</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<p>The lasers have a specific condition which were manipulated by using different functions that work together.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<p>What I learned from this prototype is how javascript handles functions when passed as an argument. The hardest part of making this is figuring out how to make the game more exciting than just simply adding random lasers and disabling them with a button. 
    So my solution was to make this game a puzzle.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<p>I cannot remember the exact name of this game, but there is a game where you are working at an office where you have to
    defuse bombs for a living. In that game, you were given a set of instructions and you have to make sure you cut the correct wires. If you incorrectly cut the wires in the wrong
    order, the bomb will explode and the game will be over.

</ul>
<p>The rest were either made from scratch, pulled from Phaser documentation, or were pulled from my previous works</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<p>Disable the lasers safely or else grandma will explode</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>Elderly Person</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<p>The input for this game is mostly indirect and uses clickable buttons to control the hazards and instruct the grandma to move.
    There is no randomness and it is mostly deterministic. The play style is director (you control whether you want grandma to move) and this game is a puzzle.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<p>I wanted to see how well a player can follow instructions and also how to make intricate parts of the puzzle communicate with each other</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<p>I want players to think carefully before making their decision</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay (INSTRUCTIONS ARE LOCATED HERE):</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<p>The main controls for this game are just buttons where players can click on them to activate certain events. As part of this game, there will be a set of instructions and the player needs to carefully read over the instructions or else they will lose.
    When the player thinks that everything is safe, they will press the "Move Grandma" button to move the grandma to the goal post. If the grandma touches a laser, she will explode. Otherwise, if the grandma reaches the end, the player wins.
</p>
<p>
    THIS IS THE MANUAL THAT IS PART OF THE GAME:
    <ul>
        <li>If purple laser touches yellow laser, do not disable purple laser</li>
        <li>The rightmost laser does nothing</li>
        <li>If the yellow button turns green after 1 press, press it two more times to disable the yellow laser</li>
        <li>The button controlling the red laser is the yellow button, but in red</li>
        <li>Only on the second press of the yellow button can you safely disable the red laser</li>
        <li>Do not touch the red button after disabling the red laser</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<p>There is no time limit (so far) in this game. So players should take their time and slowly read through the instructions and not jump to conclusions</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<p>In a dark forest, a lost grandma is trying to return back to her home. However, there is a science experiment going on, which involve dangerous lasers and explosions, and you are the only person who can operate on the laser machine. 
    Unfortunately, the only available manual for the machine is a crumbly, old piece of paper that contains some broad instructions.
    <p>The scenario for this game is tense game because a single mistake will cause the grandma to explode. The player needs to read the instructions carefully</p>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<p>This game is intended for audiences aged 10 and up</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<p>This game should take no more than 5 minutes to play</p>
</li>
