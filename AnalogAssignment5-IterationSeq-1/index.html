<h2>Peter's Analog Assignment 4 Iteration Sequence 2: Yutnori for Wizards... Kinda</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<p>This game was originally intended to be a BulletHell, but then it evolved into a modified version of Flappy Bird and I stuck with it. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? / Why I do not like Phaser
<p>This game is made using the Unity game engine. There are several reasons why I chose not to use Phaser 3. The first being that it is extremely difficult to see where I am placing my sprites and game objects. Having to figure out where to place objects through trial and error wastes a lot of my time whereas in Unity I can simply click and drag and know exactly where it is placed. Second, I was able to easily create groups without having to manually guess and check where to place objects within said group. This is especially apparent when it comes to hitboxes. Thirdly, I felt creatively restricted when using Phaser and I often do not know what I'm looking for because I can't find what I needed. What's frustrating is that many of the examples are outdated and I often spend hours searching for something end up empty-handed. In Unity, there are thousands of Youtube videos on nearly everything and I was able to figure out what I needed fairly quickly. Also, Unity's documentation is much easier to read and follow than Phaser's, they provide examples as to how it should look like. Fourth, I had a much easier time managing colliders and triggers in Unity since Unity has built-in functions that handle that. Phaser does have collision detection, but it is often very confusing and I often lose track of the many objects that interact with each other. Whereas in Unity, I can generalize a specific group of objects by either referring to their tag, or even their name, which is very convenient. Lastly, I was a bit frustrated with the Update() function in Phaser 3, especially when it comes to basic controls. There was a consensus amongst several of my classmates where they had encountered a strange bug where their character will be stuck moving in one direction. There were also complaints of strange interactions with different objects whenever they try to implement physics. The fix in Unity would be to use FixedUpdate(), but I had an extremely difficult time finding the equivalent in Phaser. The same can be said regarding DeltaTime, which enables me to record the relative time for a given event. </p>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<p>The hardest for me was bringing all the objects together and provide me the correct data when a player collides on a station. I wanted each station to charge up when a player stands on it, but it was extremely difficult to find methods to directly take an overlap function inside of an object. So I had to hardcode each station's characteristics. Otherwise, I learned a lot about developing on different scenes and scene transitions.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<p>
    This game is an iteration. One feedback that I received is that the game as a bit too easy, so I added projectiles as the final phase (the dogs). The necromancer's speed correlates to the total charge instead of charged individual nodes. I also added a timer so that players can compare their performance with others.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<p>Charge up all stations to defeat the necromancer!</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>N/a</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<p>The input for this game is mostly direct and uses arrow keys to move. The game is mostly deterministic. The play style is in between explorer and collector. You explore to find each station, and you collect them by charging them up. The genre is probably overhead since this is from the top-down view.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<p>I wanted to see if the station charging mechanic works and if the presence of the necromancer will make things stressful/put more pressure on the players.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<p>I want players to feel pressured by the presence of something chasing them.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<p>
    Players can move their character around using the arrow keys. The objective of this prototype game is to activate all magic stations while also avoiding contact with the necromancer. The difficulty actually increases each time the player completes charging a station. So anyone who plays this game should plan their path wisely.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<p>At the beginning, the necromancer is pretty slow. This is the best opportunity to charge the center station and it is best to charge the middle station first. Otherwise, it will be extremely difficult.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<p>
    The prophecy has come true. The pure evil that is the Necromancer has returned to destroy the world. The only way to destroy such evil is through the powers of the divine artifacts that are the magic stations. Do not let the Necromancer touch you, he has the hands of death and a single touch can instantly kill a man. Unfortunately for you, the Necromancer had heard the news that you were going to charge them and is coming after you!
    <p>The scenario for this game coincides with the gameplay because it creates pressure on the player to try and avoid the Necromancer. I did design him to be menacing and annoying during gameplay.</p>
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<p>This game is intended for audiences aged 10 and up</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<p>This game should take no more than 5 minutes to play</p>
